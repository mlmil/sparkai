                        support.
                        Local. In the trenches. Raised in garages, backyard dirt football fields, concert halls, and
                        RadioShacks. <span class="highlight-orange">SPARK.STUDIO</span> grew from decades of hands-on
                        film and
                        media production work with agencies and creative teams across the Central Coast. <span

                        systems,
                        solving problems, tinkering with machines. We love knobs, switches, diagrams, tubes, sparks,

                        <p>My father learned mechanics from WWI veterans in the 1930s through the Works Progress
                            Administration, men who'd kept tanks running through the Meuse-Argonne and spoke about
                            carburetors like scripture. He ended up painting cars in a Detroit Ford shop while my mother
                            worked second shift as a janitor, 3 PM to 1 AM, cleaning senators' offices and never
                            complaining about the work. I inherited the mechanic gene from him and the work ethic from
                            her, which meant I spent my childhood taking things apart—cassette decks in 1984, linking
                            two units together to make mixtapes in the basement, not because I understood electronics
                            but because I needed to see how things connected, how they spoke to each other. In 1975, at
                            seven years old in my dad's pizza place in Hood River, Oregon, I sat in a dark corner
                            playing Pong...and understood for the first time that I was having a conversation with a
                            machine, that it was teaching me and I was teaching it back, a language I've been speaking
                            fluently for fifty years even though I failed every math test they put in front of me.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <p>That conversation never stopped. Amiga code in the '80s, online chess in LA internet cafés in
                            '94 before most people had email, building websites in '98, custom film editing rigs in the
                            2000s when off-the-shelf systems couldn't keep up, adapting vintage lenses to modern digital
                            cameras—always operating at the intersection of analog intuition and digital execution,
                            always showing up early to frontiers when things are still raw and unpolished. In 2013,
                            DeepMind taught a computer to play Pong the exact same way I learned in 1975, through trial
                            and error and conversation, and that breakthrough led to solving problems nobody thought
                            machines could solve. Now I run SPARK.AI in Ventura, California, helping creative agencies
                            and operational teams integrate generative and agentic AI into real-world workflows—not by
                            selling theory or ripping out what works, but by building hybrid systems that blend proven
                            processes with new capability. I don't wait for technology to be easy. I show up when it's a
                            frontier, take it apart, and figure out how to make it work. 1975–Present. Pong. The ball is
                            still in play.</p>
